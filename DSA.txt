Data Strucutres using java:
Data Structure:
are different ways of organizing data on your computer ,that can be used efficienlty.
example:selecting the black wood in the bundles of woods ...it will be difficult and time consuming to find if the woods are not arranged 
properly.if the woods are arranged it will be easy to find the wood in less time..

Algorithm:
set of instructions to perform the task is known algorithm
for example: if want to go to office ..we need to go through certain steps..like wakeup ,take the bus,travel,reach the 
office ,walk to go to cabbin.

why data structures and algorithms are important:
by using the data structures we can organize the data and by using this data we can perform the task is nothing but algorithm.

most companies use dsa ..because as modern applications deals with large amount of data..so inorder to maintain the data we need DSA 

Types of data structures:
there are 2 types of data strctures :
primitive data type:which are defined in built in programming language
integer
float 
char
boolean

Non-primitove data strcture:which are defined by a programmer.it is defined by using 1 or more primitve data types
 
Linear:
	 static:array
	 dynamic:linkedlist ,queue,stack
Non-linear:
	tree,graph
